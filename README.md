### Description

This is a simple use case built while following this excellent YouTube course:  
[Complete Guide to Microservices with .NET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI&t=39018s&ab_channel=LesJackson) by Les Jackson.

Although the application itself is simple, the goal of the course is to **demonstrate the architecture and tooling around building real microservices**.

### ðŸ›  Technologies Used


- **Docker** â€“ for containerizing each service  
- **Kubernetes** â€“ for deploying and managing the services in a cluster
- **RabbitMQ** â€“ for asynchronous messaging between services  
- **gRPC** â€“ for efficient communication between internal microservices  

The course walks through setting up each of these tools and how they integrate into a .NET-based microservices architecture.
